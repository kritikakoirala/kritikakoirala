# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Kritika Koirala

Iâ€™m a dedicated **Front-End Developer** based in Halifax, Canada, with 3.5+ years of professional experience building **highly functional and visually engaging web applications**. Iâ€™m actively expanding my skillset toward full-stack development, gaining hands-on experience with backend tools and technologies.

## About Me

My core expertise lies in modern front-end frameworks like **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**, with a strong passion for crafting intuitive user interfaces and turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.

Alongside front-end development, I have practical experience working with backend technologies such as **Node.js** and **GraphQL**, which supports my growth into a well-rounded full-stack engineer.

Some projects Iâ€™ve worked on include:  
- âœ… User-centric dashboards for dynamic device monitoring  
- âœ… Data-driven platforms transforming raw data into business insights  
- âœ… Personalized recommendation systems powered by advanced data analysis  
- âœ… Building scalable APIs and backend services  

I recently earned my **Masterâ€™s degree in Computing and Data Analytics**, further strengthening my abilities to analyze, visualize, and integrate data effectively in web applications. I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously learning new technologies to build better, scalable solutions.
